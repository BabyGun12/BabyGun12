# Caeasar Cipher:

This is a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) coded in C. It functions by changing the ASCII code of the characters received. 

## How to Run:

Unfortunately, C is a language that is not always easy to use. Therefore you'll need some sort of an IDE/running environment that supports it.
This is [one](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) I highly recommend. 

Once you have your compiler ready, simply run the code and input the characters/string as you see fit. It works with both lowercase/uppercase letters.
